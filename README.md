projects done in 3I005 – Probas, Stats et Info– 2020fev at Sorbonne University.

### 1st Project:

This  project aims to study the battleship game from a probabilistic point of view. 
It will first be a question of studying the combinatorics of the game, then simulating the game and implementing
different AIs to play the game.

### 2nd Project: 

The aim of this project is to study the classification methods based on statistics.
It will therefore be a question of studying probabilistic classification tools. It contains an implementation of
Naive Bayes classifier and applying it to a heart disease dataset (Cleveland database).
